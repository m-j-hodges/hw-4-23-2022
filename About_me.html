<div id="biography">
  <p>When I was a college student I did my undergraduate studies at
    CSU Chico. I studied Exercise Physiology. I enjoyed studying this subject
    and I worked as a personal trainer for some time after college. I then decided to take my career
    a different path and found a job working for SolarCity. I worked for SolarCity selling
    solar for about 3 years before SolarCity was acquired by Tesla. I then continued working
    for Tesla for another 4.5 years. After working for Tesla for an additional 4.5 years, I decided
    to leave the company. Now, I am starting a career in web development in order to 
    expand my potential. I look forward to finding a job after this bootcamp working for a tech company.
  </p>
  <p> I have lived in Las Vegas for 4 years with my two wonderful kids and my wife. We like exploring <a href="https://www.redrockcanyonlv.org"> national parks</a>,
    and spending time with family.
